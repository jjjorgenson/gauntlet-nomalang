ðŸ”„ **Real-time Integration**: Implementing WebSocket connections for live messaging

## Recent Changes
âœ… **Converted to JavaScript**: Removed all TypeScript dependencies and configuration
âœ… **Clean Library Files**: Converted supabase.js, auth.js, and messaging.js to pure JavaScript
âœ… **Authentication Infrastructure**: AuthProvider context and hooks ready for UI integration
âœ… **Updated Dependencies**: Removed TypeScript packages, kept only essential dev tools
âœ… **Fixed PATH Issues**: Updated ~/.zshrc to load nvm automatically
âœ… **Authentication UI Complete**: Login/signup screens with proper navigation and state management
âœ… **Database Schema Deployed**: All 7 tables created with real-time enabled in Supabase
âœ… **Supabase Connected**: Real project credentials configured and tested
âœ… **RLS Policies Fixed**: Implemented complete non-recursive RLS solution with SECURITY DEFINER RPC functions and trigger-based message status automation
âœ… **Conversation Creation Working**: Both direct and group chat creation work with automatic participant management
âœ… **User Search Working**: All authenticated users can search and view other users' profiles
âœ… **Message Status System**: Production-ready schema with automatic status tracking (sent â†’ delivered â†’ read) via database triggers
âœ… **Real-time Updates**: Message status changes propagate instantly across all participants' devices

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. MVP Focus: Core Messaging (Due Tuesday 9pm CT)
- [x] âœ… Database setup with RLS policies and RPC functions
- [ ] Build conversation list and message interface
- [ ] Implement basic one-on-one messaging
- [ ] Add real-time message delivery

### 2. User Profile Setup
- [ ] Create user profile screen for settings
- [ ] Implement language preference selection
- [ ] Add avatar upload functionality (basic)
- [ ] Set up push notification token storage

### 3. Basic Chat Interface
- [ ] Replace starter screens with conversation list
- [ ] Create message input and display components
- [ ] Implement basic one-on-one messaging
- [ ] Add real-time message delivery

### 4. Basic Messaging MVP
- [ ] Create conversation list screen
- [ ] Implement one-on-one messaging
- [ ] Add offline message queuing with SQLite

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Architecture
**Decision**: Use Expo SQLite for offline message queue (as specified in PRD)
**Rationale**: Provides reliable local storage with conflict resolution via UUID deduplication
**Trade-offs**: Adds complexity but ensures message reliability

**Decision**: Implement optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
**Rationale**: Critical for good user experience in messaging apps
**Implementation**: Show messages instantly, update status as server confirms

### AI Integration Approach
**Decision**: Start with basic translation features, add advanced features incrementally
**Rationale**: MVP requires core messaging first, AI features can be added in phases
**Priority Order**:
1. Language Detection (Foundation)
2. Real-time Translation (Core feature)
3. Auto-Translate (User preference)
4. Voice Transcription (Wow factor)
5. Smart Replies (Advanced feature)

### Development Strategy
**Decision**: Mobile-first development targeting Android primary
**Rationale**: Faster iteration cycle, matches PRD development setup requirements
**Testing**: Use Android emulator + physical device for comprehensive testing

## Known Challenges & Mitigations

### Time Pressure
**Challenge**: Aggressive 7-day timeline with MVP in 24 hours
**Mitigation**: Focus on core functionality first, implement AI features incrementally
**Strategy**: Use existing Expo templates and Supabase integrations to accelerate development

### Real-Time Complexity
**Challenge**: Implementing reliable real-time messaging with offline support
**Mitigation**: Follow PRD's detailed architecture specifications
**Resources**: Use Supabase's proven real-time infrastructure and documentation

### AI API Costs
**Challenge**: OpenAI API calls can be expensive with high usage
**Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive caching strategy as outlined in PRD
**Optimization**: Batch requests, cache aggressively, use cost-effective models

## Recent Changes
- **Memory Bank Structure**: Established core files (projectbrief, productContext, systemPatterns, techContext)
- **Environment Setup**: Resolved Node.js installation issues
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive PRD analysis completed

## Next Update Triggers
- Completion of dependency installation
- First successful app launch
- Database schema implementation
- Authentication flow completion
- First message sent between users

## Questions for User
1. Should I proceed with installing project dependencies and setting up the development environment?
2. Are there any specific aspects of the PRD you'd like me to prioritize or clarify?
3. Do you have a Supabase project already set up, or do I need to guide you through that process?

## Success Metrics Check
**MVP Gate (Tuesday 9pm CT)**:
- [ ] Two users can send text messages in real-time
- [ ] Messages persist across app restarts
- [ ] Offline messages queue and send on reconnect
- [ ] Basic group chat (3+ users) works
- [ ] Push notifications fire (at least foreground)
- [ ] Read receipts track message state
- [ ] Online/offline status visible
- [ ] Typing indicators work
