## Current Blockers 🚫

### 1. Supabase Project Configuration
**Issue**: Need to create Supabase project and configure environment variables
**Impact**: Cannot implement authentication or database operations
**Next Action**: Create Supabase project, get API keys, configure .env files

### 2. Database Schema Implementation
**Issue**: Need to implement comprehensive database schema
**Impact**: Cannot create user accounts or secure conversations
**Next Action**: Create all tables with RLS policies and triggers

### 3. Vercel Functions Setup
**Issue**: Need to set up Vercel project for AI integration
**Impact**: Cannot implement translation and AI features
**Next Action**: Create Vercel project and deploy serverless functions

## Known Issues & Risks ⚠️

### Time Management Risk
**Risk**: Aggressive 4-week timeline with comprehensive feature set
**Mitigation**: Focus on core functionality first, implement incrementally
**Current Status**: Well-documented approach ready for implementation

### Technical Complexity
**Risk**: Real-time messaging with offline support and AI integration is complex
**Mitigation**: Follow detailed PRD specifications and use proven patterns
**Current Status**: Architecture well-documented, ready for implementation

### AI API Dependencies
**Risk**: OpenAI API costs and rate limits could impact development
**Mitigation**: Implement caching strategy and use cost-effective models
**Current Status**: Cost optimization strategies documented

## Development Velocity Metrics
