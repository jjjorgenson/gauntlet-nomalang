# Session Context

## Current Session
**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Session Type**: Full-Stack Debugging & Database Issues
**Duration**: Extended session (4+ hours)
**Agent**: Full-Stack Agent

## Session Focus
**Primary Task**: Fix Direct Chat Display Names and RLS Issues
**Success Criteria**: 
- Direct chats display other user's username instead of "Direct Chat"
- RLS policies working correctly for conversation creation
- New conversations created with proper participant management
- Database queries optimized with proper JOINs
**Dependencies**: 
- Supabase RLS policies (completed)
- Database migration 028 (completed)
- Authentication system (completed)
**Blockers**: None - all dependencies resolved

## Session Scope
**Files to Work On**: 
- `src/services/database.js` - Fixed getUserConversations with proper JOIN queries and participant filtering
- `src/screens/ChatsScreen.js` - Removed debug logging, simplified to use database service results
- `src/lib/supabase.js` - Fixed AsyncStorage configuration for JWT transmission
- `supabase/migrations/028_conversation_creation_function.sql` - SECURITY DEFINER function for conversation creation
- `docs/memory-bank/sessionContext.md` - Updated session context

**APIs to Integrate**: 
- Supabase RLS policies for secure conversation creation
- PostgreSQL SECURITY DEFINER functions for bypassing JWT issues
- AsyncStorage for proper session persistence

**Testing Required**: 
- New conversation creation with proper participant management
- Direct chat display names showing other user's username
- RLS policies working correctly
- Database queries returning proper participant data

**Documentation Updates**: 
- `docs/memory-bank/sessionContext.md` - Updated current status
- `docs/memory-bank/progress.md` - Updated progress tracking

## Session Notes
**What Worked**: 
- SECURITY DEFINER function for conversation creation bypasses JWT transmission issues
- AsyncStorage configuration fixes session persistence
- Proper JOIN queries in getUserConversations get all participants
- Client-side filtering to find "other" participants for direct chats
- Migration 028 creates conversations with proper participant management

**What Didn't**: 
- Initial RLS policies caused "new row violates row-level security policy" errors
- JWT token not being transmitted in Authorization headers
- Old conversations only have 1 participant (creator) in database
- Multiple separate queries instead of efficient JOINs
- Debug logging cluttering console output

**Decisions Made**: 
- Use SECURITY DEFINER function for conversation creation to bypass RLS issues
- Implement proper JOIN queries with client-side participant filtering
- Remove debug logging for cleaner console output
- Handle edge cases where conversations have only 1 participant (fallback to "Direct Chat")
- Use AsyncStorage directly instead of custom storage adapters

**Next Steps**: 
- Test new conversation creation with other users
- Verify direct chat names display correctly for new conversations
- Consider fixing old conversations by adding missing participants
- Implement group chat naming and participant management

## Handoff Notes
**For Next Session**: 
- RLS issues resolved with SECURITY DEFINER function approach
- Database queries optimized with proper JOINs and participant filtering
- New conversations will display correct usernames for direct chats
- Old conversations still show "Direct Chat" (only have 1 participant in DB)
- AsyncStorage configuration working for session persistence

**Completed**: 
- ✅ RLS policy issues resolved with SECURITY DEFINER function
- ✅ Database queries optimized with proper JOINs
- ✅ Participant filtering implemented for direct chat names
- ✅ Debug logging removed for cleaner console output
- ✅ AsyncStorage configuration fixed
- ✅ Migration 028 creates conversations with proper participants
- ✅ getUserConversations method completely rewritten
- ✅ ChatsScreen simplified to use database service results

**In Progress**: 
- Testing new conversation creation with other users

**Blocked**: 
- None - all blockers resolved

## Technical Achievements
- **RLS Security**: SECURITY DEFINER function bypasses JWT transmission issues
- **Database Optimization**: Proper JOIN queries with client-side filtering
- **Session Management**: AsyncStorage configuration fixes session persistence
- **Participant Management**: Migration 028 creates conversations with all participants
- **UI Cleanup**: Removed debug logging for cleaner console output
- **Query Efficiency**: Single query gets all participants instead of multiple queries

## Key Files Created/Modified
- `src/services/database.js` - Complete rewrite of getUserConversations with JOIN queries
- `src/screens/ChatsScreen.js` - Simplified to use database service results, removed debug logging
- `src/lib/supabase.js` - Fixed AsyncStorage configuration for proper JWT transmission
- `supabase/migrations/028_conversation_creation_function.sql` - SECURITY DEFINER function for conversation creation
- `docs/memory-bank/sessionContext.md` - Updated session context

## Ready for Next Phase
The codebase is now ready for:
1. **Testing New Conversations** - Create conversations with other users to verify display names
2. **Group Chat Management** - Implement proper group naming and participant display
3. **Old Conversation Fix** - Optionally fix old conversations by adding missing participants
4. **UI Polish** - Status indicators and enhanced conversation list features
