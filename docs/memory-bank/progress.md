## What Needs To Be Built üìã

### MVP Core Features (Due Tuesday 9pm CT)
- [ ] **Project Setup**: Navigate to project directory and install dependencies
- [ ] **Supabase Integration**: Set up database connection and authentication
- [ ] **Database Schema**: Create users, conversations, messages, and related tables
- [ ] **Authentication Flow**: Email/password signup and login
- [ ] **User Profiles**: Profile creation with language preferences
- [ ] **Conversation Management**: Create and list conversations
- [ ] **Real-Time Messaging**: Send and receive messages with WebSocket
- [ ] **Offline Queue**: SQLite-based message queuing for offline support
- [ ] **Optimistic UI**: Immediate message display with status updates
- [ ] **Message Persistence**: Messages survive app restarts
- [ ] **Basic Group Chat**: Support for 3+ users in conversations
- [ ] **Push Notifications**: Foreground notifications (basic implementation)
- [ ] **Read Receipts**: Track sent/delivered/read status
- [ ] **Online Status**: User presence tracking
- [ ] **Typing Indicators**: Real-time typing status

### AI Features (Post-MVP)

### Advanced Features (Final Submission)
- [ ] **Polished UI/UX**: Professional design implementation
- [ ] **Demo Video**: 5-7 minute demonstration video
- [ ] **Deployment**: App store ready deployment

## Current Blockers üö´

### 1. Environment Setup
**Issue**: Project dependencies not yet installed
**Impact**: Cannot proceed with development until resolved
**Next Action**: Install dependencies and verify development environment

### 2. Supabase Configuration
**Issue**: Database connection not established
**Impact**: Cannot implement core messaging features
**Next Action**: Set up Supabase project and configure connection

### 3. Authentication Setup
**Issue**: User authentication system not implemented
**Impact**: Cannot create user accounts or secure conversations
**Next Action**: Implement Supabase Auth integration

## Known Issues & Risks ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Time Management Risk
**Risk**: Aggressive 7-day timeline with MVP in 24 hours
**Mitigation**: Focus on core functionality first, implement incrementally
**Current Status**: On track but need to start implementation immediately

### Technical Complexity
**Risk**: Real-time messaging with offline support is technically challenging
**Mitigation**: Follow PRD's detailed specifications and use proven Supabase patterns
**Current Status**: Architecture well-documented, ready for implementation

### AI API Dependencies
**Risk**: OpenAI API costs and rate limits could impact development
**Mitigation**: Implement caching strategy and start with basic features
**Current Status**: Translation caching strategy documented

## Development Velocity Metrics

### Estimated Effort Remaining
- **MVP Core Features**: ~16-20 hours (2-3 days focused work)
- **AI Features**: ~20-25 hours (additional 3-4 days)
- **Polish & Demo**: ~8-10 hours (1-2 days)

### Daily Capacity Planning
- **Today (Day 1)**: Environment setup, dependency installation, Supabase configuration
- **Tomorrow (Day 2)**: Authentication, user profiles, basic messaging structure
- **Day 3**: Real-time messaging, offline queue, optimistic UI
- **Day 4**: Group chat, push notifications, read receipts
- **Day 5**: Language detection, basic translation features
- **Day 6**: Advanced AI features, UI polish
- **Day 7**: Final testing, demo preparation, deployment

## Testing Strategy

### MVP Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Message queue, offline storage, authentication flows
- **Integration Tests**: Real-time messaging, database operations
- **Manual Testing**: Two-user messaging scenarios, offline/online transitions

### AI Feature Testing
- **Translation Accuracy**: Test with multiple language pairs
- **Voice Transcription**: Test in various environments
- **Cultural Context**: Verify appropriate explanations

## Success Gates Check
