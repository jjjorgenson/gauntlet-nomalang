## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Project Setup and Environment
- [ ] Set up clean development environment
- [ ] Install all required dependencies
- [ ] Configure Supabase project and environment variables
- [ ] Set up Vercel functions for AI integration
- [ ] Initialize Expo project with proper structure

### 2. Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement database schema with all tables and RLS policies
- [ ] Set up Supabase authentication system
- [ ] Configure real-time subscriptions
- [ ] Implement basic message storage and retrieval

### 3. MVP Core Features (Week 1)
- [ ] Real-time one-on-one and group chat
- [ ] Basic chat UI with dark mode
- [ ] Typing indicators
- [ ] Read receipts
- [ ] Message editing with constraints
- [ ] Offline message persistence

### 4. AI Features (Week 2)
- [ ] Auto-translation with language detection
- [ ] Slang detection and explanation
- [ ] Formality adjustment
- [ ] Voice message transcription and translation

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Architecture
**Decision**: Use serverless-first architecture with Vercel + Supabase
**Rationale**: Zero ops overhead, pay-per-use pricing, auto-scaling built-in
**Trade-offs**: Cold starts possible, but acceptable for class project scale

**Decision**: Implement async-by-default AI processing
**Rationale**: Translation happens after message delivery (non-blocking)
**Implementation**: Show messages instantly, update with translations as they arrive

**Decision**: Client-side language detection with franc library
**Rationale**: Reduces server load and API costs
**Fallback**: OpenAI API detection if confidence <80%

### AI Integration Approach
**Decision**: Use GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective translation
**Rationale**: 10x cheaper than GPT-4, sufficient quality for messaging
**Priority Order**:
1. Language Detection (franc + OpenAI fallback)
2. Real-time Translation (GPT-4o-mini)
3. Voice Transcription (Whisper API)
4. Slang Explanation (on-demand only)
5. Cultural Hints (daily cron job)
6. Formality Adjustment (magic wand feature)

### Development Strategy
**Decision**: JavaScript-only (NO TypeScript) as specified in PRD
**Rationale**: Faster development, no build step, matches class requirements
**Implementation**: ES6+ with ES Modules throughout

**Decision**: Mobile-first development targeting Expo Go for testing
**Rationale**: Faster iteration cycle, cross-platform compatibility
**Testing**: Use Android emulator + physical device for comprehensive testing

## Known Challenges & Mitigations

### Time Pressure
**Challenge**: 4-week timeline with comprehensive feature set
**Mitigation**: Focus on core functionality first, implement AI features incrementally
**Strategy**: Follow detailed PRD specifications and use proven patterns

### AI API Costs
**Challenge**: OpenAI API calls can be expensive with high usage
**Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive caching strategy as outlined in PRD
**Optimization**: Batch requests, cache aggressively, use cost-effective models

### Real-Time Complexity
**Challenge**: Implementing reliable real-time messaging with offline support
**Mitigation**: Follow PRD's detailed architecture specifications
**Resources**: Use Supabase's proven real-time infrastructure and documentation
