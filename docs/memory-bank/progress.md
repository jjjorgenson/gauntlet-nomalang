## Current Blockers 🚫

### 1. Project Setup
**Issue**: Need to initialize clean Expo project structure
**Impact**: Cannot proceed with development until resolved
**Next Action**: Set up proper project structure and install dependencies

### 2. Environment Configuration
**Issue**: Need to configure Supabase and Vercel environments
**Impact**: Cannot implement core messaging features
**Next Action**: Set up Supabase project and Vercel functions

### 3. Database Implementation
**Issue**: Need to implement comprehensive database schema
**Impact**: Cannot create user accounts or secure conversations
**Next Action**: Create all tables with RLS policies and triggers

## Known Issues & Risks ⚠️

### Time Management Risk
**Risk**: Aggressive 4-week timeline with comprehensive feature set
**Mitigation**: Focus on core functionality first, implement incrementally
**Current Status**: Well-documented approach ready for implementation

### Technical Complexity
**Risk**: Real-time messaging with offline support and AI integration is complex
**Mitigation**: Follow detailed PRD specifications and use proven patterns
**Current Status**: Architecture well-documented, ready for implementation

### AI API Dependencies
